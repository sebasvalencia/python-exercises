## 🚀 Basic Level Exercises
1️⃣ Compare Two Numbers
- Ask the user for two numbers.
- Print which of the two numbers is greater.
- If they are equal, print it.
- Files:
```bash
src/compare_numbers.py
tests/test_compare_numbers.py
```

2️⃣ Check if a Letter is a Vowel
- Ask the user for a letter.
- If it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print "It is a vowel."
- Otherwise, print "It is not a vowel."
- Only considers lowercase letters.
- Files:
```bash
src/vowels.py
tests/test_vowels.py
```

More exercises will be added for different levels, focusing exclusively on Python programming concepts.
